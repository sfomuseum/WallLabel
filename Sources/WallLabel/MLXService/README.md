# MLXService

This is barely modified code copied wholesale from the [ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Applications/MLXChatExample/README.md) `MLXChat` example code. It is the bare minimum code to fetch models from HuggingFace and cache them locally.

It has been lightly updated to provide logging for download progress using `swift-log` rather than updating a UI element.
